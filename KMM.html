<h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
<p> I'm Katie! I'm an east coast girl discovering the beauty of the west coast for a few more days before I begin another adventure! I love to travel and experiencing other cultures and different prespectives. I'm a strong believer that you'll never get where you deserve to be by staying in your comfort zone. I love good wine, meaningful quotes and a good sales.  My happy place is enjoying a beautiful sunsets over the ocean. </p>

<h2> EXPERIENCE </h2>
<p> My professional experience spands from Cable TV, live digital streaming and product development!  Over the last ten months, I've been working on the product team launching all the digital products for the New American Cable Network, Al Jazeera America! Our small team created and launcged a fully responsive website and extensive CMS in just four months! We have also been working hard mobile and tablet applications for the channel- be on the look out in AppStores and Google Play!  Prior to  Al Jazeera, I was in sales at Ustream, one of the largest live streaming platforms in the world. Before moving to San Francisco, I spent several years working in Media Sales at cable networks such as BRAVO, Discovery Communications and Current TV in New York City. I've always been very passionate how the media landscape is changing due to new products and innovative and I'm looking forward to bringing my unique prespective to the world of web development!
