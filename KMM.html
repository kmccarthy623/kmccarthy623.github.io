<h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
<p> I'm Katie! I'm an east coast girl discovering the beauty of the west coast for a few more days before I start my next adventure back East! I love to travel and experiencing other cultures and different prespectives. I'm a strong believer that you'll never get where you deserve to be by staying in your comfort zone. I love good wine, meaningful quotes and a good sale.  My happy place is enjoying a beautiful sunset over the ocean. </p>

<h2> EXPERIENCE </h2>
<p> My programming experience is limited (this is my very first webpage), but my professional experience is vast and spans from Cable TV, live branded digital streaming and product development!  Over the last ten months, I've been fortunate enough to work (and learn) on the product team rolling out all the digital products for the new American Cable Network, Al Jazeera America! Our small team is responsible for all things digital at AJAM, but most importantly we launched a fully responsive website and extensive CMS in just four months in August and we've been making LOTS of enhancements ever since! Aside from the site, I've been working extensively the upcoming mobile and tablet products for the channel.  The main channel Apps are not out yet, but be on the look out in AppStores and Google Play very soon!  Prior to  Al Jazeera, I was in sales at Ustream, one of the largest live streaming platforms in the world, where I helped faciliated live streaming for major brands.  Before moving to San Francisco, I spent several years working in Media Sales at television networks such as NBC Universal, BRAVO, Discovery Communications and Current TV in New York City. During my time in sales, I've sold and worked on countless media campaigns ranging from Clorox multiplatform sponsorship in Top Chef to the live streaming component of the UN Climate Change Conference in Qatar and everything in between. I've always been very passionate about media and how the media landscape is changing due to innovative technology and I'm looking forward to bringing my unique prespective to the world of web development!
